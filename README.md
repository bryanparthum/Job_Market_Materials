## Overview

This repo contains some templates for creating your vitae (academic and professional), research, teaching, and diversity statements, and your cover letter. I also included a spreadsheet (`Jobs.xlsx`) that I used to keep track of job postings, if my letter writers had submitted their letter, links to the post, and other things. 

Plan ahead, stay calm, you are doing everything right. Congratulations for making this far in your career and I am excited for the things you are going to go on to do. Believe in yourself!

## Workflow

I chose to have an Overleaf project for each of these. That way, when I downloaded (or pushed to GitHub if you are hosting everything there), the project name would already be the necessary final file name. For example, I had a project titled *Parthum_Vitae* that would produce `Parthum_Vitae.pdf`, making the use of this file direct and simple to upload to applications. Find what works best for you (but also, don't be the person that uploads a file like `My_cv_v4 (1).pdf`, just don't do it).

## Vitae

In this folder you will find templates for both an academic vitae (`academic.tex`) and professional/industry resume (`industry.tex`).I have left some of my information and entries in there to get you started. In general, if you have a lot of accomplishments, awesome! But if you don't, don't water down the few good things by adding the many little things just to make your CV longer. Only include things that are *important*. Committees are reading 400+ CV's and you want them to know what is *important*, not everything. 

Academic CV's can be as long as they need—although for the market you will typically try to keep it to 4 pages (two pieces of paper) so committees can manage all of these things. Remember, your goal is to make the committee want to interview you, not to show them how many pieces of paper you can make them print (unless that's the job you're applying for, then go nuts).

Professional resumes are *typically* 2 pages (one piece of paper). Many people will tell you to keep it to one page, and that's fine, too. The general motivation behind keeping it to 1 page (one side of one piece of paper) is that a hiring manager might not even look beyond the first page. But IMO, that's their fault for not being more interested in doing their job well.

Again, find what works for you. 

## Statements

In this folder you will find three templates. They all use the same formatting, but I have included all three to share the items and information that I chose to include in each. The text should be personal to *you*. You will probably rewrite these a dozen times until you are happy with how they read. You will find a research statement (`Research_Statement.tex`), teaching statement (`Teaching_Statement.tex`), and a diversity statement (`Diversity_Statement.tex`). 

Many institutions only request the first two. Some institutions only provide a spot for one general statement. In the case of the latter, I would group all three statements together and submit one statement file that included all three. Do what you think is appropriate and what works best for you.

## Cover Letter

This folder contains one cover letter template. I chose to use the same template for all applications (academic, LA schools, federal, postdocs, and industry). Inside of this template I typically had one paragraph that would be a foundation for all letters. I then had a block section for each type of institution/agency that the letter would be written to. I found this to work well for me and all 130+ applications I submitted. You might find otherwise.

Many people will use a single template for *all* letters. They would then loop through a database of job listings and simply have a script replace the necessary fields. I realize this brings the marginal cost of an application to near zero. I am not a fan of this type of approach to a job search. I catered my letters to each institution, including faculty or colleagues that I would like to work with or projects that I am particularly excited about. This made the application process much longer, but much more personal. It worked well for me and I knew that I was deeply interested in every application I submitted. Find what works for you: either a shotgun approach—apply to everything—or the more piecewise approach of applying to only the jobs you are excited about.

## Job Spreadsheet

This is a spreadsheet that I created to help me keep track of job postings, closing dates, letters, etc. It is pretty self-explanatory, but here are a few tips. There are four worksheets (Jobs, Postdocs, Responses, and Data). I chose to keep full-time positions separate from postdocs, just for bookkeeping purposes. I also kept a worksheets for the responses in case there was additional information that was requested, or about the date and time of the interview. This way I wasn't frantically searching through emails to find something important, or even worse, missing an interview all together. 

The `data (do not change)` worksheet is one that the other worksheets reference in their date column. This is how I color-code items that are approaching their deadline. The parameters can be changed. For example, if you want the entry to change to yellow when the due date is 7 days away, instead of the 14 as I have it set now, you would simply change cell A2 to `=TODAY()+7` instead of `=TODAY()+14`.
