    {\textbf{The Recreation Response to Changes in Mountain Snowpack}} \\
    with Peter Christensen \\
    \textit{Dissertation Chapter I}
    \item[] Many mountain towns rely on climate amenities such as wintertime precipitation to generate local economic activity. However, climate models predict large reductions in annual snowfall that could greatly reduce the recreational value of these markets. Harnessing a unique panel of daily transactions from the short-term property rental market, we combine daily weather, daily resort snowpack, and daily resort snowfall to estimate the causal effect of changes in resort snowpack on visitation in 219 resort markets across the United States. We make three primary contributions to the study of climate change: 1) we develop a new method to estimate elasticities for climate amenities by matching the spatial and temporal variation in the level of the amenity with the frequency of related market transactions; 2) we derive state-specific snowpack elasticities for all major markets across the United States and find significant heterogeneity in the behavioral response across states; and 3) we estimate year-to-year variation in the recreation revenue from snowpack under current and future climate scenarios. We predict that resort markets could face reductions in local snow-related revenue of -40\% to -80\%, almost twice as large as previous estimates suggest. This translates to a lower-bound on the annual willingness to pay to avoid reductions in snowpack between \$1.55 billion (RCP4.5) and \$2.63 billion (RCP8.5) by the end of the century.

    \item[] \textbf{A Recreational Demand Model for Snowpack} \\
    with Peter Christensen \\
    \textit{Dissertation Chapter II}
    \item[] We estimate utility functions for winter recreationists in 219 resort markets across the United States to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for climate amenities such as snowpack, temperature, and precipitation. In order to address a dimensionality problem in the computational estimation of the likelihood function, caused by the large choice set that the consumer faces when making a decision of where and when to make a trip, we randomly sample from the available set of outside options to relax restrictions surrounding conventional (conditional) logistic estimation (IIA). Using this approach, we recover a distribution of preference parameters for climate amenities that allow for more realistic substitution patterns when solving the consumer's problem. However, simply allowing for substitution only provides part of the story. We extend the analysis by incorporating the demand estimation framework of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) to estimate own and cross-snowpack elasticities. We recover a substitution matrix which provides us with the ability to refine estimates of damages under future climate scenarios by predicting substitution patterns of snow tourists. We find that failing to account for spatial and temporal substitution misestimates the spatial distribution of welfare loss, but aggregate welfare is not significantly different under the two assumptions. We also find that welfare damages are substantially larger than simple estimates of lost revenues that we derive in the first paper. We estimate that by end of the century (2100) total welfare losses across the U.S. are between \$9.35 billion and \$14.2 billion per snow season due to reductions in mountain snowpack. Site substitution is an important phenomenon, but will not reduce the overall threat that climate change poses to this ecosystem service.

    {\textbf{Overlooked Benefits of Nutrient Reductions in the Mississippi River Basin}} \\
    with Amy W. Ando \\
    \textit{Dissertation Chapter III}
    \item[] Improvements in local surface water quality in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) can contribute to the regional environmental goals of reducing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. To inform estimates of the benefits of water quality policy, we use a choice experiment survey in a typical sub-watershed of the MRB to estimate willingness to pay for local environmental improvements and helping to reduce hypoxia far downstream. We find that residents place large values on reduced local algal blooms, improved local fish populations and diversity, and meeting local commitments to help with the regional environmental problem.
